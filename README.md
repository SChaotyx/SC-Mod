# SC-Mod
My personal mod for GD with some hacks that help me (terrifying code because it's my first time with c++).

# Includes:
- Practice music.
- No transition.
- Text length bypass.
- Character filter bypass.
- Hide attempts label.
- Slider limit bypass.
- Free window resize.
- Some buttons in the pause menu for quick access to options, level comments, level leaderboard and quests.
- Replaced profile button (from https://github.com/MikaKC/FutureDash).
